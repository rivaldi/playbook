Idea:  A web page/app dedicated to designing and viewing custom football play books.

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX, JSON

Phase 1:

	⁃	Set up site repository on either Github or Bitbucket.
	⁃	Come up with a supported device list for both desktop and tablet devices.
	⁃	Evaluate possible animation libraries for use with the site.  GSAP and at least 3 others. http://www.jsdb.io/animation/
		-	http://greensock.com
		-	http://VelocityJS.org
		-	http://jeremyckahn.github.io/shifty/
		-	http://jqueryui.com
		-	http://jstween.org

Phase 2:

	⁃	Set up HTML/CSS framework for the "Viewing Room" page of the site which will include a playing field and remote control.

Phase 3:

	⁃	Code JQuery / CSS animations for players on the field.  Start with 5 routes/patterns.
	⁃	Load JSON for individual animations.

Phase 4:

	⁃	Get remote control working for all typical functions.  Play / Pause / Stop / Fast Forward / Rewind / Slow Motion

Phase 5:

	⁃	Set up HTML / CSS framework for the "Play Design" page.


7/10 Notes:
Deadline, Thursday July 17
- Set up some animations using greensock (any kind)
- Set up some controls for animations
- Draw up a JSON structure for what a play should contain

7/25 Notes:
- Change existing javascript to include a for loop for the tweens and players.
- Be able to change the number of players
- Think about objects vs. arrays (in JSON) for performance reasons.  Make modifications to current JSON object if necessary.  Link to Nate after mods.

8/13 Notes:
- look into how to create an empty array (so you can put stuff in it)
- how do you add stuff to the array, because in the loop we'll want to create a tween and add it to the array with the same index that the player has.
- how do you access it? (you already have that)
- update the play controls to use the array access for players/movements
- add a button that can add a player dynamically
- add a button that can remove last added player dynamically

8/26 Notes:
- Forget deleting player for now.
- Create tween when player is created.
- Refactor for being able to add players on the fly, encapsulate
- Make new players that are added move
- Load the json file
