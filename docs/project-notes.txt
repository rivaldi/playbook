Idea:  A web page/app dedicated to designing and viewing custom football play books.

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX, JSON

Phase 1:

	⁃	Set up site repository on either Github or Bitbucket.
	⁃	Come up with a supported device list for both desktop and tablet devices.
	⁃	Evaluate possible animation libraries for use with the site.  GSAP and at least 3 others. http://www.jsdb.io/animation/

Phase 2:

	⁃	Set up HTML/CSS framework for the "Viewing Room" page of the site which will include a playing field and remote control.

Phase 3:

	⁃	Code JQuery / CSS animations for players on the field.  Start with 5 routes/patterns.
	⁃	Load JSON for individual animations.

Phase 4:

	⁃	Get remote control working for all typical functions.  Play / Pause / Stop / Fast Forward / Rewind / Slow Motion

Phase 5:

	⁃	Set up HTML / CSS framework for the "Play Design" page.
